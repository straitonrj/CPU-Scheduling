# CPU Scheduling
Welcome to the project repository for my CPU Scheduling project. This project aims at implementing CPU Scheduling algorithms such as:
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

This project was developed in a virtual Linux Ubuntu Enviornment and utilizes Visual Studio code to allow for development in C#. This project emulates a working enviornment in
which a developer would be expected to modify and add to an already existing program, optimize performance, and provide a professional evaluation. On top of typical development, this
project's scope includes measuring key performance metrics for each algorithm. These key performance metrics include:
- Average Waiting Time (AWT)
- Average Turnaround Time (ATT)
- CPU Utlization (%)
- Throughput (Processes per Second)
